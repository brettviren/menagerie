#+title: My script menagerie ü¶úüêíüêç

This holds the subset of scripts I've developed / collected / adapted over the years that may potentially be useful to others.

You are free to use them according to the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html][Affero General Public License (AGPL)]].

Some scripts have personalized configuration information that requires you to hack them for them to be usable in your environment.

The scripts are organized by implementation language:

- [[file:bash/][bash]]
- [[file:python/][python]]

Most scripts begin with comments providing a usage description and/or will print this info with ~-h/--help~  options or no options.

Most scripts are stand-alone but some utilize shared code or behavior:

Bash scripts:

- Some will try to install needed programs if they are not available.  They will run ~sudo apt-get install~.  
- Some use the provided [[bash/helpme.sh][helpme]] CLI helper.

Python scripts

- Most have [[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/][uv script magic]] to satisfy dependencies, ~uv~ is effectively required.
- Many use Click for CLI.
